# Cocoa-PKGMGR
Cocoa is a wrapper around Win-Get to make downloading apps from the Microsoft Store much easier >:3



# HOW TO USE:
Just put the cocoa.exe in that dist folder inside that folder you downloaded into System32. (Don't worry, no virus It's even Open Source.)
That way, you can summon the Cocoa package manager from CMD by using ``cocoa``.
